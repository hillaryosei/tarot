The same forces that govern the changing of the seasons, or the rising and setting of the sun is also the master of luck and the fate of individuals. Where it lands is as random as chance - you may find yourself at either the top or bottom, but remember that no matter what the outcome it may not last for very long, for the wheel always turns.', 'wheel'),
    new card('Justice', 'The decisions that you make now have long-term effects in all things, both for yourself and others. There will always come a time where you will be judged. If you have been wronged, this card may bring you relief. On the other hand, if your actions caused pain to others, this card serves as a warning. Her appearance represents a chance for you to change your actions now for a better future.', 'justice'),
    new card('Hanged Man', 'The hanged man understands that his position is a sacrifice that he needed to make in order to progress forward - whether as repentance for past wrongdoings, or a calculated step backward to recalculate his path onward. This time he spends here will not be wasted, he does this as part of his progression forward. Alternatively, The Hanged Man card reflects a particular need to suspend certain action. As a result, this might indicate a certain period of indecision. This means that certain actions or decisions which need to be properly implemented are likely to be postponed even if there is an urgency to act at this particular moment.', 'hanged-man'),
    new card('Death', 'The Death card signals that you are currently ending a major phase in your life (or about to), and a new one is going to start.

You have found yourself trapped between the short-term pleasure you receive and the longer-term pain you experience. To break free of these negative patterns, you need to acknowledge the hold they have over you and the impact they are having on your life and take action to free yourself. It is unlikely that this will be remedied overnight, so a tremendous amount of willpower and strength FROM YOU is required.', 'devil'),
    new card('The Tower', 'The Tower represents change in the most radical and momentous sense. The kind of event that the Tower card marks does not have to be something terrible, like a disaster or a great loss.  Change itself is a normal part of life that one has to embrace. But it can sometimes strike fear, for it means that we must abandon the truths that we have known prior to this event. The old ways are no longer useful, and you must find another set of beliefs, values and processes to take their place. Be positive, it is time for you to replace the old foundations of the past with something that is more genuine and will serve you better in what is to come.', 'tower'),
    new card('The Star', 'The Star brings hope, renewed power, and strength to carry on with life. It shows how abundantly blessed you are by the universe as evidenced by the various things around you. It may not be directly evident at the moment, for this card follows the trauma of the Tower card. Remember that you hold within you all that you need for your fulfillment - the only thing that you need is courage. For this, you have all reasons to rejoice. To see this card is a message to have faith, for the universe will bless you and bring forth all that you need.', 'star'),
    new card('The Moon', 'On one hand, the Moon card can symbolize your imagination is taking the best of you. In the dark of the night, you are taking a path that you are unsure of, for there could be danger lurking in its depths. You are the crawfish embarking on the path in the card. The moonlight can bring you clarity and understanding and you should allow your intuition to guide you through this darkness. You need to be aware of the situations that are causing fear and anxiety in your mind, whether it is now or in the future. It alerts you not to allow inner disturbances and self-deception to take the best of you. These deep memories and fears must be let go, and the negative energies must be released and turned into something constructive. Another reading of the Moon card is the existence of illusion. Some hidden truth must be discovered, for what you are seeing now may just be a trick of the light', 'moon'),
    new card('The Sun', 'The card shows that you have a significant sense of deserved confidence right now. Life is currently particularly good, and the sun is shining your way as you reach the goals that you set.

It is through self-reflection that we can have a clearer and objective understanding about where we are now, and what we need to do in order to grow as humans. The Judgement card reminds us that we all will be faced with choices that will have an astounding effect for your entire life. The card brings to mind moments where actions you have taken have changed the course of your path for good. There may have been a moment where there is no looking back.

    new card('The Magician Reversed', 'The reversed Magician is a master of illusion. The magic that he performs is one of deception and trickery. You may be lured in by the showmanship of his arts, but behind that there may be an intention to manipulate for selfish gain', 'magician-reversed'),
    new card('The High Priestess Reversed', 'Something has been telling you to follow your gut, but you may be ignoring the call. There is a lot of confusion around you, and your actions may feel contrary to what you know is right. You must never be afraid to ask questions of yourself that may illuminate a new path forward for you, one that is more authentic to your inner self and your individual values.', 'priestess-reversed'),
    new card('The Empress Reversed', 'you have lost too much of your own willpower and strength because you have started placing too much effort and concern to other peopleâ€™s affairs and opinions. You might be neglecting your own needs, or even smothering the ones you love with your well-intentioned actions', 'empress-reversed'),
    new card('The Emperor Reversed', 'Assess your relationship with power, control, authority, responsibility and discipline. Are you expressing too much or too little of these elements in your life right now? Are they working for you or against you?. Healing from father-child relationship', 'emperor-reversed'),
    new card('The Hierophant Reversed', 'You are being guided to follow your own path and adopt your own belief systems rather than blindly following others. Challenge the status quo. See alternative ways of viewing the world and test the very ideas and concepts you were taught were the truth.', 'hierophant-reversed'),
    new card('The Lovers Reversed', 'You may be feeling out of sync with those around you, particularly your loved ones. You may find your relationships are strained and communication is challenging. Does it seem as if you are just not on the same page and no longer share the same values? If so, come back to the reason you have this person in your life. If you love them unconditionally, know this moment shall pass and the best you can do is bring love and compassion to the situation. In other cases, you may realise that you have simply grown apart and itâ€™s time to move on. If your relationship continues to be peppered by arguments and a lack of respect for one another, then it could be time to let go. Honour yourself and do what is best for you both. Alternatively, you might face a tough choice with significant consequences. Instead of making a decision based on your values, you feel tempted to cut corners and avoid responsibility for your actions. You may think you can get away with it, but the reversed Lovers implores you to think again and do the right thing â€“ no matter how hard it might be.', 'lovers-reversed'),
    new card('The Chariot Reversed', 'You are at the mercy of the opposing forces and the obstacles, and cannot seem to muster the strength to take over. You are taking everything lying down, and life is dragging in any direction that it pleases. This is a wakeup call and reminder that you will need to tighten some loose ends and take charge of your destiny', 'chariot-reversed'),
    new card('Strength Reversed', 'You are (or about to) experience an intense anger or fear in your life. You seem to be lacking the inner strength that this card normally represents, meaning you might be experiencing fear, and a lack of conviction and confidence in your own abilities. You must learn to gain confidence in order to re-harness your inner strength', 'strength-reversed'),
    new card('The Hermit Reversed', 'You are perhaps in a situation where you would like to be alone; there is nothing wrong about that. However, there is a possibility that your seclusion may become harmful to both yourself and others. Though the Hermit sets forwards with noble intentions to search for his inner truth, his path inward may also be filled with great danger. Going inward may lead to madness and the abyss, for the unconscious is filled with images that he may not yet understand, lurking and waiting to lure you ever inside. You must learn to balance your need for truth with connection to your fellow human', 'hermit-reversed'),
    new card('The Wheel of Fortune Reversed', 'Luck has not been on your side and misfortunes have been following you. You must understand that thereare things that cannot be moved by human will and action alone. When we do not let go, it can bring only more suffering, for you may blame yourself for actions that could not have altered the situation. When we learn to accept, we also learn to forgive ourselves. We learn to move on, and move forward - and eventually, we learn that this feeling of acceptance can push the wheel again forward, and move it towards a new cycle.', 'wheel-reversed'),
    new card('Justice Reversed', 'The appearance of this card in reversed is to show you are living in denial. You are not willing to accept the consequences of your actions or others. You are running from your guilt. You must however, be aware that these are actions that are in the past. Your future depends on your actions today - and what you will do to tip the scales in balance again. How can you make up for your wrongs? Taking action gives you a chance to change and stop judging yourself.', 'justice-reversed'),
    new card('Hanged Man Reversed', 'The reversal meaning of the Hanged Man card represents a very specific period of time during which you feel as if you are sacrificing a significant amount of time while getting nothing in return. Do not be shy to set boundaries with yourself and others', 'hangedman-reversed'),
    new card('Death Reversed', 'The Death reversal meaning is still about change, but that you have been resisting it. You could be worried about letting go of the past, or you could not be sure of the changes that you need to make to go forward. This will limit your future, which can cause you to feel like you are in limbo. You should take some time to assess the ways that you have been approaching changes in your life. You may find you have been halting the changes that you need due to fears of the unknown. While you can still be afraid, you should trust that you are taking the right steps and move forward. Life moves on, so fighting passing time is only going to leave you with regrets.', 'death-reversed'),
    new card('Temperance Reversed', 'Temperance in reversed is a reflection of something that is out of balance and may be causing stress and anxiety. Lack of a long-term plan or vision may also be the Temperance reversal meaning. This creates a lack of purpose for you, leaving you feeling lopsided as you search here and there for what you should be doing. You must reflect and think carefully about what needs to change. Temperance reminds us that all things are only good in moderation, and that we must examine in which aspects of our lives we are breaking the balance.','temperance-reversed'),
    new card('The Devil Reversed', 'You are on the verge of a break-through or an up-levelling. However, for this to happen, you are called to confront your inner fears and anxieties to free yourself from the chains that bind you to your limiting beliefs and unhealthy attachments.', 'devil-reversed'),
    new card('The Tower Reversed', 'When you get the Tower card reversed, you can feel some crisis looming along the horizon, and you are struggling as much as you can to try and avoid its manifestation. What you have not realized is that these breakdowns can be beneficial in breaking down your reliance on something that is false. The tower is built on faulty foundations, and it must fall. Though the destruction will be painful, the humbleness resulting from it can bring us peace.', 'tower-reversed'),
    new card('The Star Reversed', 'When the Star card is reversed, it means that you are feeling as though everything has turned against you. The challenges that you would normally see as exciting seem instead to make you feel as though you cannot overcome them. You have lost faith in something, whether inside yourself or with something you normally find dear. Without hope, without faith, we cannot find the motivation to progress forward in the challenges that we face. Where in your life are you feeling hopeless? In what ways do you already feel defeated? And how does that affect your actions? The star reversed asks us to nurture our sense of hope and positive energy to help propel our actions with joy instead of fear.', 'star-reversed'),
    new card('The Moon Reversed', 'A Moon reversal in a reading can sometimes indicate that the darker and more negative aspects of the moon are present in your life. It could represent confusion and unhappiness - you want to make progress, but you are not sure what is the right thing to do. You must deal with your anxiety and fears by overcoming them, for they are like shadows in the dark. It is time to believe in yourself and move forward. Another reversed moon meaning is that the forces of the night that are bringing you confusion are starting to dissipate. You have started managing your fears and anxiety. Whatever negative energies you have been facing are slowly fading away. It presents a liberating experience as you discover the positive side of things.', 'moon-reversed'),
    new card('The Sun Reversed', 'In the reversed position, the Sun indicates that you might have significant difficulties finding positive aspects to certain situations. The clouds might be blocking out the warmth and light that you need to progress. This might be preventing you from feeling confident and powerful. You may experience certain setbacks which are damaging your optimism and enthusiasm. On the other hand, the Sun reversed might be indicative that you are being unrealistic. It might be a sign that you have an overly optimistic perception of certain situations. These are things that you need to take into account in order to ensure that you are on the right track and your successes continue as they do.', 'sun-reversed'),
    new card('Judgment Reversed', 'The reversed Judgement card can mean that you doubt and judge yourself too harshly, which could be causing you to miss opportunities that were awaiting you. The lost momentum causes you to fall behind in your plans, which can make it difficult to move forward. This means you should be moving forward with pride and confidence, not with caution. Alternatively, the card can be a push to take time out of your busy routine to reflect upon your life to this point, and what you have learned so far. You are most likely not giving yourself the time or space to fully think about the matter and learn the lessons you need to to be able to progress with awareness. You could also be too critical of your past actions, so you are not giving yourself the forgiveness to move forward. The mistakes that we have made in the past are learning tools, so they help us move though life. Focusing too hard on these mistakes can cause us to trip and fall.', 'judgment-reversed'),
    new card('The World Reversed', 'You are drawing near to something that marks the end of a journey or an era. You may have many accomplishments that have lined your path, but there is a strange emptiness that fills you when you look backwards upon it, as if you have all the pieces but they are not coming together. What is missing? Do you feel connected to what you are doing? Do you feel connected to others? What alienates you from feeling complete? From feeling whole?', 'world-reversed'),

    new card('Two of Cups', 'This card indicates that any relationship is built on the union of forces, a strong connection and a balanced and equal partnership. When it comes to work, you may notice that the people around you will start to appreciate you more. There is a mutual respect here, meaning you will also be more comfortable in your workplace. If you are looking for new job opportunities, this card may be a good sign. In terms of love, the card represents commitment, a balanced relationship, and love. But this does not simply mean that you will no longer need to nurture your love to make it last. The card only signifies that true love and affection is present. In finances, the Two of Cups is associated with fairness and balance. This means that you are currently financially capable and you have the right amount of money to deal with your obligations. In relation with your health, people who are currently facing some health issues need to look for a practitioner that they will be comfortable working with and whom they can trust. In spirituality, it is a call for you to be more endearing and loving towards the others. You are receiving positive energy from the universe, and you need to share that energy.', 'two-cups'),
    new card('Three of Cups', 'The meaning behind the Three of Cups represents a period of happiness. You will be able to forget the worries of your daily life and spend quality time with family and friends. To see the Three of Cups can indicate a happy reunion with a long lost friend, relative, or loved one. It can also mean a celebration, whether it is your own or for someone who you love. Also, if you are having problems with your social life, this card can signal the end of those hardships. You will be able to resolve differences and learn how to deal with the problem.', 'three-cups'),

You are feeling apathetic - regardless of what happens, whether the day is good or bad, none of it matters to you. The Four of Cups commands a self-evaluation of your attitude so that you can pull yourself out of this rut. Our lives are short, and sometimes monotonous, but we must create meaning for ourselves. The solution is likely right in front of you, the hand is offering you a way out, but you release yourself out of your mental stubbornness and deploy new approach.', 'four-cups'),
    new card('Five of Cups', 'The Five of Cups symbolizes disappointment, and the feelings that come when things go differently as you expected. You are feeling unhappy that a certain situation hasnâ€™t really turned out the way you have hoped it would. Instead of moving towards a more positive perspective, this card seems to say that you are dwelling in the past, inducing feelings of self-pity and regret.','five-cups'),
    new card('Six of Cups', 'The Six of Cups upright generally represents generosity, naÃ¯ve happiness, and childhood. It can stand for you wanting to return to a happier time, whether it was when you were a child, teenager, or young adult. Many times, these memories are things of the past, which reflect the aspects of ourselves that have vanished. You may feel that remembering these times is the only way to feel happy. The Six of Cups appearing in a reading seems to indicate that while we may look upon the past with a happy eye, we must avoid living in it. Coming after the Five of Cups, this card can also suggest that you may have suffered a loss or disappointment of sorts, and you are making the journey home. You are looking to the past to find the answer to the crisis or challenge that you are facing now. You may be seeking the comfort and warmth of people that unconditionally love you, gathering strength to face the trials that are in front of you.', 'six-cups'),
    new card('Seven of Cups', 'To draw the Seven of Cups in a reading shows that you need to clearly see the shadows and visions in your imagination, not only in your dreams but also in the real world. You should be careful of wishful thinking and be alert of the choices that you make. Alternatively, the Seven of Cups is a reminder that although it is good to have dreams and wishes, it is even better to take action attaining those dreams. At one point in life, you will need to stop fantasizing and face the reality of life.', 'seven-cups'),
    new card('Eight of Cups', 'Getting the upright side of this card shows that you are dissatisfied with your life and need to experience a higher purpose in life. You may have been exploring your options, flitting about from one choice to another, tasting the wine in each cup, as a means to sort out what it is that you really want with your life. You are now experiencing a feeling of exhaustion - and are coming to a realization that you must step away from what is familiar. It is a choice, and a recognition that true happiness will not be found in what you have already created. ', 'eight-cups'),
    new card('Nine of Cups', 'After a long journey, the Nine of Cups symbolizes the finding of self-satisfaction. The emotional journey of the cups is starting to come to a close after the volatile ups and downs you faced in the earlier numbers of this suit. You have struggled to find purpose and joy after loss, you have tasted the different things that life offers, and you have left comfort in order to find greater heights. Here, you have found them, and you are indulging yourself as you celebrate this new stage of your life.

Take a moment and breathe, look around you and be thankful for all your blessings. This card signifies something that so many of us are searching for.', 'ten-cups'),
    new card('Page of Cups', 'One of the most important meanings within the Page of Cups is that you should be open to new ideas, especially ones that stem from intuitive inspiration. The card seems to state that such inspiration should be embraced, despite it being something that you may not expect. It could lead you to adventure and open many doors. If it is a calling of a creative nature, for example, one to get into music or art, there is an especially strong push from this card to go for it. For those that are afraid to reveal their emotions, the Page of Cups could mean that it is time to release and show those emotions. The creative you and the emotional you should both be expressed, no matter how insignificant they may seem. In most cases, some people cannot express themselves as they want to protect their ego. The Page of Cups indicates that it is alright to have a new beginning - to welcome the real you.', 'page-cups'),
    new card('Knight of Cups', 'When faced with an actual decision, the Knight of Cups is going to listen to their heart, regardless of whether this is actually a logical choice or not. They can also manifest as an event or a person in your life, or a part of your own self. They appears as a messenger â€“ and with them, they carry an invitation or an arrival of something or someone which is going to have a certain emotional benefit for you. As a knight, they are also charged with taking the gifts of their suit, and bringing it outward into the world.

They seem to say that you should take the time to focus on your emotional health before trying to help others. Self-love creates compassion. The Queen of Cups normally thinks with their hearts, instead of their mind. They can lack rationality and common sense, but they can also be intuitive, dreamy and almost psychic at times. The Queen of Cups could be the answer to your problems when a logical approach is not working.', 'queen-cups'),
    new card('King of Cups', 'The King of Cups represents creativity, emotion, and the unconscious. The card shows the ability to restrain emotions and be fully in charge of your feelings and impulses. Therefore, the King of Cups represents a balance between the intellect and emotions. When you have balanced your emotions and are able to control them, it means that you have a deeper knowledge and awareness of yourself. When you are faced with challenges that would normally throw you off balance, the King of Cups is there to remind you that you should act as he does - do not fly out in a rage, or immediately throw yourself into despair! You first need to temper the state of your emotions, so that you can progress forward in reality. Learn to evaluate yourself so as to determine how you can create a stronger awareness of your own internal state. There are instances when the King of Cups can symbolize an older individual who is in your life. This is a mature person who is willing to take responsibility for their actions and has mastered their self-understanding.', 'king-cups'),

    //suit of cups reversed
    new card('Ace of Cups Reversed', 'Seeing the Ace of Cups upside down during your reading means you have been enduring emotional instability or pain for some time. There is a loss that is indicated here, and perhaps something that has meant much to you is no longer giving you the joy that it once had. Since the cups also govern creativity, you may also be experiencing a creative block of sorts, and where the waters of inspiration once flowed, they have now dried up.  In all these cases you must examine who or what is in control of the cup - which party allowed it to overturn? What can you do to place it right side up again?', 'ace-cups-reversed'),
    new card('Two of Cups Reversed', 'When reversed, the Two of Cups can mean that the balance that was once there is broken. This balance was an integral part of keeping the individuals together, but to break it is to create disconnection and discord. The negative energy of two forces is present, and instead of them joining or attracting, they seem to repel each other.You may be finding that certain small details that were not problems before are coming into play, signaling that one party may have resentments. A line of communication that allowed you and the other party to openly talk about disagreements has been cut off, only worsening the cycle of resentment and imbalance.Be the first to open up, and you may find the problem much easier to repair than you thought it would be.', 'two-cups-reversed'),
    new card('Three of Cups Reversed', 'When the Three of Cups is reversed, it means that you may have no time to socialize or go out with friends. You may be too busy with school or work that you canâ€™t spare some time to have fun. The Three of Cups reversed can also mean losing touch with some of your friends. As time passes, you may find that you are growing apart from one another. When we grow older, we must put in effort to make sure that our friendships are not neglected. Alternatively, the Three of Cups reversed can mean that there is a lack of balance and harmony within your social circle. Gossip and scandal can rear their ugly heads. Perhaps there is envy hidden within this circle, and as a result, you are feeling isolated.', 'three-cups-reversed'),
    new card('Four of Cups Reversed', 'While in the upright four of cups, you may be suffering from apathy and ignore the opportunities that the universe offers you, the reversed four of cups signals the desire to have a new start. You are coming to the understanding that though life is not perfect, there is beauty in it, and joy comes from choosing to see this beauty. Embrace new ideas, new people and new places; because you never know where these adventures can take you. Many may miss these chances because they are too confined in their own beliefs and ambitions.', 'four-cups-reversed'),
    new card('Five of Cups Reversed', 'When the card is reversed, the Five of Cups shows a significant recovery from the regret as well as proper acceptance of your past. You are beginning to realize all of the implications of your actions, and you have finally come to appreciate the lessons which can be learned from that experience. You are seeing that the suffering and grief that you endured gave you strength and imbued you with resilience. You are ready to pick up the two remaining cups which are still full and go on with your life in full force.','five-cups-reversed'),
    new card('Six of Cups Reversed', 'The Six of Cups reversed can mean that you are clinging to the past. You should explore your memories, but you should not allow yourself to remain there. While you may find it comforting to be in the security of home, you must also learn to forge your own path. The past should be used as a guide for the future. Learn to focus on the present, and truly be aware. Another reading of the Six of Cups reversed is that you may feel as though you are disconnected from your childhood self and dreams, which may sometimes be unrealistic.
